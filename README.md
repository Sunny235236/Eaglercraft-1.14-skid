<h2>What is eaglercraft?</h2>
Eaglercraft, or EaglercraftX, is an open source browser minecraft project developed by Lax1dude. Eaglercraft uses TeaVM to compile java code into javascript, allowing real Minecraft to run in all major web browsers. Eaglercraft is the original 1.5.2 version, while EaglercraftX is the name of the 1.8.8 port. It is completely free and open source. Eaglercraft servers use EaglerXBungee, or EaglerBungee to allow EaglercraftX Clients to connect. Many people have forked this project, creating PvP clients that improve the experience of the game.
